# CollegeLife

A forum for Stevens students to help them discuss some of the problems they might encounter. Students can post queries in
categories regarding specific courses and other students can upvote/downvote the problem or post their own responses, similar to a StackOverflow post. Students can interact with one another in the comments section on each page. We also hope to expand this to include topics such as events, clubs, or on-campus activities.
